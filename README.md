### Description
This project is a collection of my Python coding practices from Udaciy nano-program *Programming for Data Science with Python*.

It covers basic Python coding, Numpy and Pandas.

### Contents
With both .py and Jupyter notebook files, this project covers:

**1. Basic Python Coding**
* Files with *Python_* at the beginning but not followed by np or pd
* all .py files not start with *_np* or *_pd*
* most common hour of day

**2. Numpy**
* Jupyter files start with *Python_np_*
* *.py* files start with *np*

**3. Pandas**
* Jupyter files start with *Python_pd_*
* *.py* files start with *pd*

### Software used
* Python 3, NumPy, and pandas
* Atom
- Terminal on Mac

### Credits
* In this project, I used examples provided by [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd104/dashboard/overview).
